# Markov Localization and the Kidnapped Vehicle

The localization module culminates in the Kidnapped Vehicle situation. In this situation, our vehicle has been kidnapped and placed in an unknown location. We must leverage our knowledge of localization to determine where our vehicle is.

Markov Localization or Bayes Filter for Localization is a generalized filter for localization and all other localization approaches are realizations of this approach. By learning how to derive and implement this filter, we develop intuition and methods that will help us solve any vehicle localization task, including implementation of a particle filter.

We generally think of our vehicle location as a probability distribution, each time we move, our distribution becomes more diffuse (wider). We pass our variables (map data, observation data, and control data) into the filter to concentrate (narrow) this distribution, at each time step.

## Localization Posterior: Introduction

What we want to estimate is the transformation between the local coordinate system of the car and the global coordinate system of the map. If we know this transformation, then we also know poses of the car in the global map.

**We assume these variables are known:**

* A map with all landmarks in a global coordinate system, which could be a grid map of the global environment, or a database, which includes global feature points and the lane geometry. Here, we do not add the time index t to the map because we assume the map does not change over time (**m** represents the map, which could be grid maps, feature maps, landmarks).



* Observations from the on-board censor, which are defined as a vector **z**, which includes all observations from timestep one to t. The observations could be range measurements, bearing angles, or images (**z<sub>1:t</sub>** represents the observation vector from time 0 to t (range measurements, bearing, images, etc)). 


* The local coordinates system and the information how the car moves between two time steps. We also have the controls of the car as a vector **u** which includes all control elements from time step one to t. Typically, you have low pitch or roll rates and velocity information (**u<sub>1:t</sub>** represents the control vector from time 0 to t (yaw/pitch/roll rates and velocities)).



**These values are unknown:**

The position of the car at time t is defined with **x**, If we assume we have a 2D map for example, x includes a position with x and y coordinates and the orientation phi.


* x and y coordinates and also the orientation phi (**x<sub>t</sub>** represents the pose (position (x,y) + orientation θ)).

We will never know the state **x<sub>t</sub>** with perfect accuracy. What we want is to form a sufficiently accurate belief of the state  **x<sub>t</sub>** and we want to formulate this belief in a probabilistic way. The definition of the posterior distribution for the state x at time t can be explained like below:

## Localization Posterior: Explanation and Implementation


Localization is all about estimating the probability distribution of the state xt, which is the pose of the car, another condition that all previous observations that from time 1 to t (see above figure). Before we go deeper into math, I want to show you how we define the different input data for a specific 1D localization scenario. This means I will explain and show you how the car is sensing and moving and how the map looks.

1. Map

* The map includes the position of street lamps and trees in 1D, this means we are working with landmark-based maps, which are, in general, sparser than grid-based maps. In the 1D case, the map is a vector of the position where these objects are. Here, the map includes six landmarks with the values 9, 15, 25, 31, 59, and 77.

2. Observation

* For the observation, we state that the car measures the nearest k seen static objects, in driving direction. 
* We assume that the car can detect the distances to street lamps and trees, this results in an observation list which includes, for each time stamp t, a vector of distances z<sub>t</sub>, from 1 to z<sub>t</sub><sup>k</sup>.

3.  Control vector

* The control vector includes a direct move of the car between consecutive time stamps. This means the control is defined by the distance the car traveled between t and t minus 1. In this case, the car moves 2 meters to the right.

**The true pose of the car is somewhere on the mapped area. Since the map is discrete, the pose of the car could be any integer between 0 and 99 meters. This means the belief of x<sub>t</sub> is defined as a vector of hundred elements, and each element represents a probability that the car is located at the corresponding position. The goal is now to estimate these values.**
