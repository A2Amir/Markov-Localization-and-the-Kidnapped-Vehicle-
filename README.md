# Markov Localization and the Kidnapped Vehicle 
 Markov Localization or Bayes Filter for Localization is a generalized filter for localization and all other localization approaches are realizations of this approach. By learning how to derive and implement this filter, we develop intuition and methods that will help us solve any vehicle localization task,
